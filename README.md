## 1. Information Systems Support for Decision Making

Decision-making is a core activity at every organisational level (operational, tactical, strategic). Information Systems (IS) provide timely, accurate, and relevant information to support these decisions, helping to reduce uncertainty and improve efficiency.

### 1.1 Types of Decisions Supported by IS

Decisions are classified based on their routine nature and complexity:

*   **Structured Decisions**
    *   **Definition:** Routine, repetitive, and well-defined decisions with clear, programmable procedures.
    *   **Examples:** Payroll processing, inventory control, reordering stock.
    *   **IS Support:** Primarily supported by **Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)** and **Management Information Systems (MIS)**, which provide predefined reports and automate processes with minimal human judgment.
*   **Semi-Structured Decisions**
    *   **Definition:** Decisions that fall between structured and unstructured; part can be automated, but managerial judgment is still essential.
    *   **Examples:** Marketing campaign planning, budget preparation, loan approval.
    *   **IS Support:** Supported by **Decision Support Systems (DSS)**, offering analytical models, "what-if" analysis, forecasting, and interactive tools that combine quantitative data with managerial insights.
*   **Unstructured Decisions**
    *   **Definition:** Novel, complex decisions involving a high degree of uncertainty, with no standard rules or procedures.
    *   **Examples:** Entering a new market, developing a new product line, mergers and acquisitions.
    *   **IS Support:** Supported by **Executive Support Systems (ESS)** and **Knowledge Management Systems (KMS)**, providing access to external information, historical data, expert opinions, and advanced analytics with visualisation tools.

### 1.2 Role of IS in Managerial Decision Making Levels

Managers at different levels require varying IS support due to differences in decision scope, frequency, and complexity:

*   **Operational Level (Lower Level Management)**
    *   **Nature of Decisions:** Routine, repetitive, structured, short-term, day-to-day operations.
    *   **Examples:** Employee scheduling, order processing, inventory management, payroll.
    *   **Role of IS:** **TPS** for routine processes and **MIS** for summarised daily/weekly reports, ensuring accuracy, speed, and efficiency.
*   **Tactical Level (Middle Management)**
    *   **Nature of Decisions:** Semi-structured, requiring data analysis and human judgment, medium-term planning.
    *   **Examples:** Budgeting, resource allocation, marketing campaigns, production planning.
    *   **Role of IS:** **DSS** provides "what-if" analysis, forecasting, and analytical models to help evaluate alternatives and generate comparative reports.
*   **Strategic Level (Top Management / Executives)**
    *   **Nature of Decisions:** Unstructured, complex, long-term, high uncertainty.
    *   **Examples:** Market expansion, mergers and acquisitions, new product development, overall business strategy.
    *   **Role of IS:** **ESS** provides dashboards, trend analysis, and external data, while **KMS** captures expert knowledge for strategic insights, aiding in risk evaluation and organisational direction setting.

### 1.3 How Information Systems Improve Decision-Making Effectiveness

IS enhance decision-making through several key mechanisms:
*   **Providing Accurate and Timely Information:** Ensures up-to-date, reliable data.
*   **Enhancing Speed of Decision-Making:** Automated systems reduce delays in data collection and reporting.
*   **Supporting Analysis and Forecasting:** Utilises analytical models, forecasting tools, and "what-if" scenarios.
*   **Reducing Uncertainty and Risk:** Provides simulations, risk analysis, and predictive analytics.
*   **Enabling Better Communication and Collaboration:** Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS) and collaborative tools facilitate team decisions.
*   **Improving Strategic Planning:** EIS/ESS help track performance and external trends.

## 2. An Early Framework for Computerised Decision Support

The **Gorry and Scott Morton’s Framework (1971)** was a pivotal early contribution, combining two dimensions to classify how computerised decision support could be applied:

### 2.1 Framework Dimensions

1.  **Type of Control / Management Activity (Robert Anthony)**:
    *   **Operational Control:** Ensuring tasks are executed efficiently.
    *   **Managerial Control:** Acquiring and using resources effectively.
    *   **Strategic Planning:** Long-term decisions affecting overall direction.
2.  **Type of Decision Problem (Herbert Simon)**:
    *   **Structured:** Routine, repetitive, programmable problems.
    *   **Unstructured:** Novel, complex problems with high uncertainty.
    *   **Semi-Structured:** Problems that are partly structured and partly unstructured.

### 2.2 Classification of Decisions in the Framework

The framework created a 3x3 matrix showing decision situations and their IS support:

| Management Level   | Structured (Routine)      | Semi-Structured              | Unstructured (Complex)     |
| :----------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **Operational Control** | Payroll processing, order entry | Inventory management, quality control | Handling customer complaints |
| **Managerial Control** | Budgeting, credit approval | Production scheduling, sales planning | New product introduction |
| **Strategic Planning** | Short-term financial planning | Mergers & acquisitions analysis | Entering a new market |

### 2.3 Significance of the Framework

This framework highlighted that different decisions need different IS support, laying the foundation for **DSS development** and the realisation that IS could support strategic decision-making, not just routine tasks. It is still a reference for understanding DSS and Business Intelligence.

### 2.4 Evolution of Decision Support Systems (DSS)

The early framework significantly influenced the evolution of decision support:

1.  **Early Frameworks (1960s–1970s):** Focused on computer-based support, mostly model-driven DSS (e.g., inventory reordering).
2.  **DSS as a Distinct Field (Late 1970s – Early 1980s):** Emerged with a focus on interactive support for semi-structured decisions, leading to model-driven and data-driven DSS.
3.  **Expansion and Technology Integration (Mid-1980s – 1990s):** Incorporated DBMS, user-friendly interfaces, networking, Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS), and Executive Information Systems (EIS/ESS).
4.  **Rise of Business Intelligence (1990s – 2000s):** DSS evolved into BI platforms with Data Warehousing and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), integrating historical, current, and external data.
5.  **Analytics and Big Data Era (2000s – Present):** Shifted to predictive and prescriptive analytics, integrating with Big Data technologies (Hadoop, Spark), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for decision automation and cloud-based support.
